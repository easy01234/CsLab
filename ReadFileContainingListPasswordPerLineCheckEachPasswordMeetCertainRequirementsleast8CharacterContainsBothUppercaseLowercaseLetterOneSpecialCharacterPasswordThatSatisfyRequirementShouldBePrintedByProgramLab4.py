#Program no:4
#Write a Python program that reads a file containing a list of passwords, oneper line. It checks each password to see if it meets certain requirements(e.g. at least 8 characters, contains both uppercase and lowercase letters,and at least one number and one special character). Passwords that satisfy the requirements should be printed by the program.



import re

def check_password(password):
    # Password should have at least 8 characters
    if len(password) < 8:
        return False
    # Password should contain at least one uppercase letter
    if not re.search(r'[A-Z]', password):
        return False
    # Password should contain at least one lowercase letter
    if not re.search(r'[a-z]', password):
        return False
    # Password should contain at least one number
    if not re.search(r'\d', password):
        return False
    # Password should contain at least one special character
    if not re.search(r'[!@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<>]', password):
        return False
    return True

# Open the file containing the passwords
with open('password.txt', 'r') as f:
    # Read the passwords line by line
    for line in f:
        password = line.strip()  # Remove any extra spaces or newline characters
        # Check if the password meets the requirements
        if check_password(password):
            print(password)
